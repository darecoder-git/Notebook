# Notebooks

This repository contains all of my works on machine learning, including a variety of projects, experiments, and research related to the field. The repository includes machine learning algorithms that I have implemented from scratch using Python and popular ML libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, as well as pre-trained machine learning models that I have created for tasks such as object recognition, natural language processing, and time series forecasting.

In addition to these projects, the repository also includes tutorials and guides on how to use these algorithms and models, including code examples and detailed explanations. I have also included research papers and articles that I have written on new developments and applications of ML techniques.

Overall, this repository provides a comprehensive collection of my works on machine learning, showcasing my skills and knowledge in the field. It is a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn more about machine learning or collaborate on ML projects. I am always looking for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and apply my skills in the field of machine learning.
