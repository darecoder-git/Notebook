I first made use of pandas and seaborn packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors you should be aware of when doing machine learning.\nNext, I used the scikit-learn package to predict whether I can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. I went over implementations of common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, decision trees, and so forth.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Preparing the data\nThese recommendations are so on point! How does this playlist know me so well?\n\nOver the past few years, streaming services with huge catalogs have become the primary means through which most people listen to their favorite music. But at the same time, the sheer amount of music on offer can mean users might be a bit overwhelmed when trying to look for newer music that suits their tastes.\n\nFor this reason, streaming services have looked into means of categorizing music to allow for personalized recommendations. One method involves direct analysis of the raw audio information in a given song, scoring the raw data on a variety of metrics. Today, we'll be examining data compiled by a research group known as The Echo Nest. Our goal is to look through this dataset and classify songs as being either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' - all without listening to a single one ourselves. In doing so, we will learn how to clean our data, do some exploratory data visualization, and use feature reduction towards the goal of feeding our data through some simple machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees and logistic regression.\n\nTo begin with, let's load the metadata about our tracks alongside the track metrics compiled by The Echo Nest. A song is about more than its title, artist, and number of listens. We have another dataset that has musical features of each track such as danceability and acousticness on a scale from -1 to 1. These exist in two different files, which are in different formats - CSV and JSON. While CSV is a popular file format for denoting tabular data, JSON is another common file format in which databases often return the results of a given query.\n\nLet's start by creating two pandas DataFrames out of these files that we can merge so we have features and labels (often also referred to as X and y) for the classification later on.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Required Library","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-03T14:03:44.906222Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-03T14:03:44.906679Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-03T14:03:44.911971Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-09-03T14:03:44.906641Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-09-03T14:03:44.911098Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"rhop=pd.read_csv('../input/eechonest/fma-rock-vs-hiphop.csv')\nDF=pd.read_json('../input/eechonest/echonest-metrics.json')\nDF=DF.merge(rhop[['track_id','genre_top']],on='track_id')\nDF.info()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-03T14:03:44.913470Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-03T14:03:44.913877Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-03T14:03:45.213195Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-09-03T14:03:44.913844Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-09-03T14:03:45.211953Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Pairwise Relationships between continous variables\n\nWe typically want to avoid using variables that have strong correlations with each other -- hence avoiding feature redundancy -- for a few reasons:\n\n* To keep the model simple and improve interpretability (with many features, we run the risk of overfitting).\n* When our datasets are very large, using fewer features can drastically speed up our computation time.\nTo get a sense of whether there are any strongly correlated features in our data, we will use built-in functions in the pandas package","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"DFcor=DF.corr()\nDFcor.style.background_gradient()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-03T14:03:57.221449Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-03T14:03:57.221859Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-03T14:03:57.255498Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-09-03T14:03:57.221824Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-09-03T14:03:57.254250Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Splitting our Data\n\nAs mentioned earlier, it can be particularly useful to simplify our models and use as few features as necessary to achieve the best result.
